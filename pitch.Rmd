.pull-left[

**Critical Thinking Detective**

<i>"This colorful 32-page book offers a collection of fun, easy-to-use detective cases for Grades 4–12+. Some cases may be more challenging for younger students, but teachers and parents can always provide hints when needed. The cases <mark>develop critical thinking skills</mark> by requiring students to read carefully and <mark>analyze and synthesize information to guide their decision-making</mark>. The cases also develop observation skills, reading comprehension, deductive and inductive thinking skills. The ability to identify and evaluate evidence is the very heart of critical thinking."</i>

.pull-right[

**The Sherlock Holmes Case Book**

<i>"Join the world's greatest fictional detective and use your own powers of deduction to solve these puzzling mysteries. The Sherlock Holmes Case Book: Solve-It-Yourself Mysteries is a remarkable collection of crimes from Dr John Watson's case notes that features all of the twists and turns that have come to be expected from a Holmes case – but now it is up to you to solve them.

There are 10 cases to be cracked, each of which <mark>requires the reader to use logic and powers of perception to answer a question at three points – the beginning, the middle and the end</mark>."</i>

# 1-minute elevator pitch

<br><br>

--

1. An interactive mystery solving book

--

2. But with science puzzles

--

3. Every puzzle case describes a study with key features (research question, design, evidence in form of text, tables, and/or visuals, and *flawed* conclusions)

--

4. Answering a set of questions, readers have to find out what went wrong

--

5. On their way, readers learn to apply the scientific method and value high vs. low quality evidence

- There's plenty supply of rigorous, modern, and entertaining textbooks on causal inference and applied stats. 

- Most of them are clearly designed for an academic audience though.

- Difficult to digest without further knowledge or accompanying course.

- Moreover, there's plenty supply of good (and bad) airport literature on "new science", "bad science", or how various biases affect human decision-making.

- They're (also) targeting a non-academic audience.

- My hunch is that the learning effect of reading those books is limited, also because reading them is a largely passive experience.

# What's missing

<br><br>

- A learning resource that trains a non-academic audience in spotting key flaws in published studies

- A way for non-academics who engage with scientific evidence (journalists, practitioners, interested public, policymakers - a non-academic audience) to apply the basics of the scientific method

- Something that is suitable for self-study, interactive learning, entertainment

## The Holmesian "science of deduction and analysis"

By a man’s finger-nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser-knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt-cuffs—by each of these things a man’s calling is plainly revealed.

3. Are you aware of similar projects?

4. How would you change/adapt the setup?

5. What are the hard skills in scientific evidence literacy that non-academics should pick up? 

6. How to avoid conditioning people on bullshitting science and make them appreciate high-quality evidence instead?

7. Can you send me more examples of flawed studies?
